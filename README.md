# Staff Scheduling Problem

> Project developed for Introduction to Optimization in the 3th year of Computer Science.

## üíª Introduction

Scheduling consists in the process of arranging, assigning, controlling and optimizing workforce resources (i.e. staff) in a service, production or manufacturing setting. It has a direct significant impact on the productivity of a process and on the organization‚Äôs labor costs.

## üöÄ The project

This project was based on the article: **Modeling a flexible staff scheduling problem in the Era of Covid-19.** [[1]](#1).

In this paper, the authors proposed optimization models to address flexible staff scheduling problems and some main issues arising from efficient workforce management during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The adoption of precautionary measures to prevent the pandemic from spreading has raised the need to rethink quickly and effectively the way in which the workforce is scheduled, to ensure that all the activities are conducted in a safe and responsible manner.
The emphasis is on novel optimization models that take into account demand requirements, employees‚Äô personal and family responsibilities, and anti-Covid-19 measures at the same time.

## ‚òï Running the code

Clone this <project>:

```
git clone https://github.com/rafacoelho4/staff-scheduling.git
```

**GUSEK** is what I used to run the optimization model [[2]](#2).
GUSEK is a standalone executable that combines the SCIntilla based Text Editor (SciTE) editor plus the linear/integer programming solver GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK).

In Tools, make sure to check "Use external .dat" and "Generate output file on go".
